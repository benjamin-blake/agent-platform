# DuckLake catalog -- Neon serverless Postgres backend (T2.16b / CD.34, pending).
#
# The Neon provider API key is NOT a variable: the provider reads it from a Secrets Manager secret
# (`neon-api-key`) created out-of-band in Phase 0 (see neon_ducklake_catalog.tf). Making it a var
# would either commit a literal or, if Terraform-managed, create a provider->resource cycle.
#
# There is no neon_org_id: this is a personal Neon account (no organization).
#
# There is no neon_catalog_allowed_ips: Neon IP-Allow is a Scale-plan feature (unavailable on the
# free tier this migration targets) and egress here is dynamic (CC-web + GitHub-hosted runners +
# Lambda), so no static allow-list is maintainable. The free-tier posture rests on compensating
# controls -- enforced TLS (sslmode=require) + a scoped non-owner neon_role + the DSN in Secrets
# Manager -- and the Neon-aware apply guard fail-closes on any neon_* update/replace/delete.
