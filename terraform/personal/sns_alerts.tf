# Shared personal-account SNS alerts topic (T2.18 FP-B / Decision 39).
#
# Decision 39: SNS is the canonical alarm/failure-notification primitive. This module
# introduces the single shared personal-account SNS topic; both the DuckLake maintenance
# circuit-breaker alarm and the catalog-DR freshness alarm target this topic.
#
# Email subscription endpoint supplied via gitignored terraform.personal.tfvars
# (alerts_email = "..."). NOT hardcoded -- no email address is committed to source.
# The subscription is created in PENDING state; the recipient must click the confirmation
# link in the initial subscription email before alarms can page (VP9 manual step).
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# APPLY POSTURE (Decision 35 + 77): HUMAN-GATED via agent_platform_admin.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# aws_sns_topic and aws_sns_topic_subscription are NOT IAM-sensitive resources, but they
# are created together with the DR Lambda (IAM role + policy), so they ride the same
# human-gated admin apply for the T2.18 FP-B apply pass.
