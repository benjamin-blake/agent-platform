# SessionStart hook: self-heal snapshot-baked dependency drift every session.
#
# bin/setup-cloud-env.sh installs requirements.txt + requirements-dev.txt (and,
# on the admin container, the terraform binary) only at snapshot-build time. A
# session booting from a snapshot built before a requirements*.txt change would
# have a stale venv missing (or mismatched on) a declared dependency -- and the
# repo is cloned fresh each session while the venv is baked into the snapshot,
# so a fresh checkout alone cannot supply it. This hook closes that gap by
# running the same idempotent sync every session: an in-sync venv is a
# millisecond fingerprint-compare no-op; otherwise it self-heals with a
# reinstall.
#
# Mirrors session_start_ensure_github_mcp.sh: advisory only, always exits 0 so a
# failed or network-blocked sync never blocks the session. Delegates to
# bin/sync-deps.sh (the source of truth shared with bin/setup-cloud-env.sh).
