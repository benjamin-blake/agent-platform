# Re-wire the pre-commit .git hook every session.
#
# The hook ENVIRONMENTS are snapshot-cached by bin/setup-cloud-env.sh
# (pre-commit install-hooks). This hook only writes .git/hooks/pre-commit, which
# lives inside .git and therefore does NOT survive the fresh per-session clone --
# so it must be re-applied each session (cheap, offline). Mirrors the self-heal
# pattern of session_start_ensure_github_mcp.sh.
#
# Once installed, `git commit` runs detect-secrets, the shape-based never-commit
# identifier denylist, ruff, and the file-hygiene hooks before the commit lands --
# blocking a bad commit at source rather than only at CI.
