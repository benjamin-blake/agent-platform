"""Standing guards for the OIDC trust invariants PLAN-repo-rename-relicense depends on.

Two DURABLE invariants -- deliberately chosen to survive the plan's PR-3 contraction, which
narrows local.github_repos back to a one-element list:

  1. Decision 94 both-sub-forms: the bootstrap apply role's trust carries BOTH the
     ref:refs/heads/main form (routine auto-apply) and the environment:tf-gated-apply form
     (the gated-apply job, where GitHub OVERRIDES sub to the environment claim). Dropping the
     environment form silently ungates every gated apply -- the VP9 regression Decision 94 was
     written to prevent, and the exact failure class the rename window makes easy to hit.

  2. Cross-root slug-list agreement: terraform/personal and terraform/bootstrap each declare
     their own local.github_repos (no cross-root resource reference is possible). The two lists
     must stay identical, or a contraction can narrow one root and miss the other -- a divergence
     otherwise caught only post-deploy by VP step 23, after the destructive apply has landed.

Neither assertion pins the NUMBER of trusted slugs: the dual-slug state is transient by design,
so a count assertion would fail the moment the plan's own cleanup lands (tests/CLAUDE.md
"Test-count coupling").
